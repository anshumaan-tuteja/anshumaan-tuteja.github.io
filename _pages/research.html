    <!-- <p> <b>Abstract</b>: This paper examines the sources of the response of stock prices to unconventional monetary shocks using a Structural Vector autoregressive model. 
    Findings from US data indicate that stock prices and its fundamental component decline in response to a contractionary monetary policy shock. 
    However, there is an increase in its bubble component, which contradicts commonly held beliefs about the impact of monetary policy on bubbles. </p> -->
