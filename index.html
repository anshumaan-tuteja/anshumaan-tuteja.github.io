					<p> Hi, welcome to my website.</p>
					<p> I am an empirical macroeconomist with research interests in monetary economics and international macroeconomics. 
					   My current work is on examining the impact of unconventional monetary policies on the real and financial economy.
					   I am also interested in exploring the sources behind the inflation expectations process among households using micro data.  </p>
